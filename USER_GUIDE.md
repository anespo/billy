## Tips for Best Results

### Bill Upload

- **File Quality**: Ensure your bill is clearly scanned or photographed
- **File Format**: PDF format usually gives the best results
- **File Size**: Keep file size under 16MB for optimal performance

### Bill Analysis

- **Complete Bills**: Upload complete bills rather than partial pages
- **Recent Bills**: Use recent bills for more accurate analysis
- **Multiple Bills**: For trend analysis, upload bills from consecutive months

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Unable to extract sufficient text"**: The uploaded file may be of poor quality or in an unsupported format. Try scanning the bill again with higher resolution.

2. **"Error in analysis"**: The system may have trouble interpreting the bill format. Try uploading a clearer copy or a different bill.

3. **"Comparison not available"**: Ensure both bills are successfully analyzed before attempting comparison.

4. **Slow processing**: Large PDF files may take longer to process. Be patient or try uploading a smaller file.
